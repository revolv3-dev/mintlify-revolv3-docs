# Authorization, Captures, and Reversals

**Authorization, Captures, and Reversals in Revolv3 API**

Revolv3’s API allows merchants to **authorize payments, capture funds, and reverse authorizations**, providing a flexible and secure payment management system. This guide explains how to:

1. **Authorize a payment** (reserve funds without charging the customer immediately).

2. **Capture a payment** (finalize and charge a previously authorized payment).

3. **Reverse an authorization** (cancel a payment hold).

Each section includes **API endpoints, request examples, and field explanations**.

1. **Payment Authorization**

A **payment authorization** checks if sufficient funds are available on the customer’s card and places a hold on the amount. The funds are **not charged** until they are **captured**.

**API Endpoint for Payment Authorization**

```
{Api Root}/api/Payments/authorization
```

**Sample API Request (Authorizing a Payment)**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "PaymentMethod": {
      "BillingAddress": {
        "AddressLine1": "100 Main",
        "AddressLine2": null,
        "City": "Santa Ana",
        "State": "CA",
        "PostalCode": "91111",
        "Country": "US"
      },
  	  "BillingFullName": "John Doe",
      "CreditCard": {
        "PaymentAccountNumber": "4111111111111111",
        "ExpirationDate": "1025"
      }
    },
    "NetworkProcessing": {
      "ProcessingType": "initialInstallment",
      "OriginalNetworkTransactionId": null
    },
    "Amount": {
      "Value": 30.99
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Explanation of API Request Fields**

| **Field**                                      | **Description**                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PaymentMethod                                  | Contains the payment details used for authorization.               |
| BillingAddress                                 | The cardholder’s billing address.                                  |
| BillingFirstName, BillingLastName              | The name on the payment method.                                    |
| CreditCard.PaymentAccountNumber                | The card number used for authorization.                            |
| CreditCard.ExpirationDate                      | The expiration date of the card (Format: MMYY).                    |
| NetworkProcessing.ProcessingType               | Specifies the type of transaction (e.g., initialInstallment).      |
| NetworkProcessing.OriginalNetworkTransactionId | Used for linked transactions (set to null for new authorizations). |
| Amount.Value                                   | The amount to be authorized (e.g., $30.99).                        |

**Alternative Authorization Using a Stored Payment Method**

Instead of passing full payment details, merchants can authorize a payment using an existing PaymentMethodId.

**API Endpoint**

```
{Api Root}/api/Payments/authorization/{paymentMethodId}
```

**Request Payload Example**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "NetworkProcessing": {
      "processingType": "initialInstallment",
      "originalNetworkTransactionId": null
    },
    "Amount": {
      "value": 1.03
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

1. **Authorization Response**

When an authorization is successful, the API returns a PaymentMethodAuthorizationId, which is required for **capturing or reversing** the payment.

**Sample API Response**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "networkTransactionId": "431241081661798",
    "paymentMethodAuthorizationId": 2055,
    "paymentMethod": {
      "paymentMethodId": 6061,
      "billingAddressId": 7056,
      "billingAddress": {
        "addressId": 7056,
        "addressLine1": "381 Forest Ave. Suite C",
        "addressLine2": null,
        "city": "Laguna Beach",
        "state": "CA",
        "postalCode": "92651",
        "phoneNumber": null,
        "email": null,
        "country": "US"
      },
      "billingFirstName": "Joe",
      "billingLastName": "Smith",
      "merchantPaymentMethodRefId": null,
      "paymentMethodCreditCardDetails": {
        "paymentLast4Digit": "1111",
        "paymentExpirationDate": "0330"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Explanation of API Response Fields**

| **Field**                                            | **Description**                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| networkTransactionId                                 | The unique ID assigned by the payment network for tracking.    |
| paymentMethodAuthorizationId                         | The unique authorization ID, required for capture or reversal. |
| paymentMethod.paymentMethodId                        | The internal ID of the stored payment method.                  |
| billingAddress                                       | The billing address associated with the payment method.        |
| paymentMethodCreditCardDetails.paymentLast4Digit     | The last four digits of the authorized card.                   |
| paymentMethodCreditCardDetails.paymentExpirationDate | The expiration date of the card.                               |

1. **Capturing an Authorized Payment**

A **capture request** charges the customer’s account for a previously authorized amount.

**API Endpoint for Capturing Funds**

```
{Api Root}/api/Payments/capture/{paymentMethodAuthorizationId}
```

**Sample Capture Request**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "CustomerId": null,
    "Invoice": {
      "MerchantInvoiceRefId": "ABC309500654810",
      "Amount": {
        "value": 1.03
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Explanation of API Request Fields**

| **Field**                    | **Description**                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| CustomerId                   | Optional; assigns the payment to a customer profile. |
| Invoice.MerchantInvoiceRefId | A unique identifier for tracking the invoice.        |
| Invoice.Amount.Value         | The final amount to be captured.                     |

**Key Notes:**

✔ The **PaymentMethodAuthorizationId** must be provided to capture the funds.

✔ A capture request **must be made before the authorization expires** (typically within 7 days).

1. **Reversing an Authorization**

If an authorized payment is no longer needed, it can be **reversed** to release the hold on funds.

**API Endpoint for Authorization Reversal**

```
{Api Root}/api/PaymentMethod/reverse-auth
```

**Sample Reversal Request**

```
{
  "PaymentMethodAuthorizationId": 1234
}
```

**Explanation of API Request Fields**

| **Field**                    | **Description**                                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| PaymentMethodAuthorizationId | The authorization ID of the payment to be reversed. |

**Key Notes:**

✔ A **reversal cancels the authorization**, ensuring that the funds are no longer held.

✔ Once reversed, the authorization **cannot be captured**, and a new authorization is required to reattempt the payment.
