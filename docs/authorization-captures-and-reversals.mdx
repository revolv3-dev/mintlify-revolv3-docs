A concise summary: This page explains how to create payment authorizations, perform captures (charge after authorization), and reverse authorizations using Revolv3 APIs. Include the API endpoints and examples below to implement each action.

## Authorization

To create an authorization use the API call below. In this response you will get a PaymentMethodAuthorizationId. You can then use this ID for the capture or a reversal

## Capture

For a Capture (charge the customer after authorization), use either the One Time Payment API or Subscription API call and use the PaymentMethodAuthorizationId instead of PaymentMethod

{{Api Root}}/api/Customers/{{Customer Id}}/subscriptions

```json
{
    "MerchantSubscriptionRefId": "1234-5678-9101",
    "BillingFrequencyType": "Monthly",
  "PaymentMethodAuthorizationId": 1234,
    "SubscriptionBillingPlans": [
        {
            "Name": "Billing Plan 1",
            "Value": 10.99,
            "CycleCount": -1,
            "ValueType": "Standard",
            "StartCycleDelay": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

## Authorization Reversal

To do a Reversal of an authorization use the API call below, use the PaymentMethodAuthorizationId from the previous API call

{{Api Root}}/api/PaymentMethod/reverse-auth

```json
{
    "PaymentMethodAuthorizationId": 1234
}
```
