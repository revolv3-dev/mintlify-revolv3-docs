## Authorization

To create an authorization use the API call . In this response you will get an PaymentMethodAuthorizationId. You can then use this ID for the capture or a reversal

## Capture

For a Capture (charge the customer after authorization) , use either the One Time Payment API or Subscription API call and use the PaymentMethodAuthorizationId instead of PaymentMethod

\{Api Root}}/api/Customers/\{\{Customer Id}}/subscriptions

```
{
	"MerchantSubscriptionRefId": "1234-5678-9101",
	"BillingFrequencyType": "Monthly",
  "PaymentMethodAuthorizationId": 1234,
	"SubscriptionBillingPlans": [
		{
			"Name": "Billing Plan 1",
			"Value": 10.99,
			"CycleCount": -1,
			"ValueType": "Standard",
			"StartCycleDelay": 0
		}
	]
}
```

## Authorization Reversal

To do a Reversal of an authorization use the API call ,use the PaymentMethodAuthorizationId from the previous API call

\{\{Api Root}}/api/PaymentMethod/reverse-auth

```
{
	"PaymentMethodAuthorizationId": 1234
}
```
