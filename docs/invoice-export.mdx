---## Overview
The **Invoice Export** feature allows users to generate a list of invoices within a specified daterange and export the data as a **CSV file**. This functionality is useful for record-keeping,reporting, or further processing in external systems.## How to Export Invoices
To export invoice data, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Invoice Export Section**• In the Revolv3 user interface, go to the **Operations** menu. • Click on **Invoice Export** in the navigation panel.
2. **Select the Date Range**• Use the date picker tool to specify the start and end dates for the invoice records you wish to export.• Ensure the selected date range covers the invoices you need.
3. **Run the Export Process** • Click the **“Run Report”** button to generate the export file.• The system will process the request and create CSV file containing invoice details.
4. **Download the Exported File** • Once the report is generated, you will have the option to download the CSV file.• Ensure the file size does not exceed 15MB, as this is the maximum allowed size for exports.## Limitations & Considerations
• The exported file must not exceed 15MB. If your data exceeds this limit, consider reducing the date range and exporting multiple smaller files. • The exported data is structured in CSV format, which can be opened with spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or any text editor supporting CSV files.
