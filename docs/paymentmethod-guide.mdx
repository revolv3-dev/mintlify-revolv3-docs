description: "PaymentMethod – Creating and Reusing in Revolv3 API"
---

Revolv3 allows merchants to create **Payment Methods** and reuse them for multiple invoices and transactions. This guide explains how to:

1. **Create a Payment Method** (generate a PaymentMethodId for future transactions).

2. **Use an existing Payment Method** (reference a stored PaymentMethodId to process payments).

Each section includes **API endpoints, request examples, and detailed explanations of request and response fields**.

1. **Creating a Payment Method**

A **Payment Method** represents a stored customer payment credential (e.g., credit card or ACH) that can be reused across multiple transactions. Merchants can either:

✔ **Create a Payment Method before creating an invoice** and store the returned PaymentMethodId.

✔ **Automatically generate a Payment Method when processing an invoice**.## API Endpoint for Creating a Payment Method
