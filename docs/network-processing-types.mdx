## Overview

Payment systems categorize transactions based on their purpose and life cycle stage. Initial transactions require explicit authentication and cardholder consent, while recurring transactions rely on pre-approved credentials for seamless subsequent payments.

This topic describes these transactions and the additional parameters to include in these requests.

In our system, the following object is used to **specify the transaction processing type**:

```
"networkProcessing": {
    "processingType": "recurring",
    "originalNetworkTransactionId": "483299310358831"
},
```

There are two parameters, each of which is optional, as is the parent NetworkProcessing object. Possible values for the **processingType** parameter are listed below. An integer value in () maybe also be used instead of a string value.

* **initialRecurring** (1) - use this value to specify the initial in a series of recurring payment transactions.
* **recurring** (2) - use this value for subsequent payments after the initial payment.
* **initialInstallment** (3) - use this value to specify the first in a series of installment payment transactions.
* **installment** (4) - use this value to specify subsequent installments after the initial installment.

The **originalNetworkTransactionId** parameter must contain the Network Transaction Id from the initial/original transaction ([Obtaining originalNetworkTransactionId](#obtaining-originalnetworktransactionid)) and therefore can only be used in conjunction with the following processing types: **recurring** and **installment**.

If you don't have originalNetworkTransactionId, processor doesn't support, or do not wish to use this option, then just omit the NetworkProcessing object in the request.

<Warning>
  ### Please note that...

  * Processing type is applicable for card payment method only.
  * ProcessingType and/or OriginalNetworkTransactionId can be processed only for Visa, Mastercard or Discover transactions.
  * If the card brand for the original transaction doesn't match the one for the current transaction, errors might occur.
</Warning>

## Obtaining originalNetworkTransactionId

You can obtain an originalNetworkTransactionId in the response at some endpoints intended to make a payment. There you will find the **NetworkTransactionId** parameter in the response, which is actually the network transaction identifier for the **CURRENT** transaction and can be used to associate any subsequent transaction with this one.

<Warning>
  ### Please remember that...

  For each payment made through these **POST** endpoints, you will receive a different **NetworkTransactionId** that is associated with that particular transaction.
</Warning>

* POST /api/payments/sale
* POST /api/payments/sale/\{paymentMethodId}
* POST /api/payments/authorization
* POST /api/payments/authorization/\{paymentMethodId}
* POST /api/subscriptions

NetworkTransactionId can also be found in some endpoints that receive entity information:

* GET /api/Invoices/\{invoiceId}

## Endpoints supporting Network Processing Types

Not all endpoints include the ability to define the **NetworkProcessing** object, so the following list will help you when you are planning an integration or to understand if you can use this feature in your current integration.

* POST /api/payments/sale
* POST /api/payments/sale/\{paymentMethodId}
* POST /api/payments/authorization
* POST /api/payments/authorization/\{paymentMethodId}
* POST /api/subscriptions It is only possible to define **originalNetworkTransactionId** in **paymentMethods** object.

## Processors for which the feature is implemented

This feature currently works for the following processors:

* WorldPay
* Adyen
* Nuvei

This means that if the request contains a **networkProcessing** object, this data will be passed to the corresponding processor, otherwise it will not.
