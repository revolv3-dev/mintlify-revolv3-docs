ACH (Automated Clearing House) Direct Debit is a payment method that allows merchants to withdraw funds directly from a customer’s bank account. It is commonly used for recurring billing, subscriptions, and invoice payments.

> **Note**: ACH Direct Debit is **not a real-time transaction**. Funds settlement typically takes several business days, and transaction status may remain pending for a period of time.

**ACH Object**

To initiate an ACH Direct Debit, you must submit an ACH object as part of your API request. The object contains the customer’s bank account information:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {   
  	"routingNumber": "string",   
  	"accountNumber": "string",   
  	"accountType": "string" 
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Field Descriptions**:

* `routingNumber`(string): The 9-digit ACH routing number of the account.
* `accountNumber`(string): The US bank account number from which the payment will be debited. The length should be between 4 and 17 characters.
* `accountType` (string): Bank account type. Possible values: Checking or Savings.

***

**Transaction Lifecycle**

ACH transactions progress through the following statuses:

* `Pending`or `RefundPending`(for refunds) – The transaction has been initiated, but final confirmation is not yet available.
* `Paid`– Funds have been successfully collected from the customer’s account.
* `Noncollectable` – The debit failed and funds could not be collected (e.g., due to insufficient funds or invalid account).

***

**Webhook for Final Status**

Since ACH is not real-time, your system must listen for updates via webhook to determine when a transaction has reached its final status.

Please subscribe to the `InvoiceStatusChanged` webhook to receive these updates.

**Account Verification**

Account verification is optional, but highly recommended before initiating a payment. Verification helps reduce fraud and prevent failed transactions.

* **Provider Selection**: Choose between **GIACT** and **Worldpay** via the portal (Settings → Merchant Settings). Only one provider can be active at a time, but you can change it if needed.

* **Endpoints**: Verification is performed via dedicated API endpoints.

> If verification fails, we recommend not proceeding with the debit request.

**Processing Time**

ACH Direct Debit is a **batch-based** system. Processing and settlement typically occur over several business days. Timing may vary depending on the customer’s bank and other factors.
