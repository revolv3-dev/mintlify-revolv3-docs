## Required Authentication Header: x-revolv3-token

Each API request must contain a unique header key called x-revolv3-token, which serves as your authentication credential. This token acts as a static key that validates your API requests, granting you the necessary permissions to interact with Revolv3’s services.

• **Your x-revolv3-token is issued through one of the following methods:**

1. Revolv3 Support – If you require assistance in obtaining your authentication token, our support team can provide it upon request.

2. Revolv3 Portal – You can retrieve your Developer Static Token directly from the Revolv3 developer portal.

When making a request, ensure that the x-revolv3-token header is included in your HTTP request, as shown in the example below:

### Example API Request with Authentication Header

### HTTP Request Method: POST

Example Endpoint: \{\{Api Root}}/api/Customers In your request, the headers should be structured as follows:

| Header Key      | Value                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| x-revolv3-token | Your unique static authentication token |
| Content-Type    | application/json                        |
| Content-Length  | \<calculated when request is sent>      |
| Host            | \<calculated when request is sent>      |

Postman Example using the header is below:

Note: A Legacy Bearer token is still supported and which creates an expiring token after 1 hour. To use this \{\{Api Root}}/api/Authentication/Token must be called to obtain a temporary token
