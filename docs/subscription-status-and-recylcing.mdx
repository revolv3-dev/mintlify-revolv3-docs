1. **Subscription Status Types**

| **Status**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Current**              | The subscription is **active** and will continue billing at scheduled intervals.                                                                                                  |
| **Cancelled**            | The subscription has been **terminated** and will not be billed again.                                                                                                            |
| **Pending Cancellation** | The subscription is **marked for cancellation** but is still within an active billing cycle. It will be fully cancelled at the end of the period if no further payments are made. |

ðŸ“Œ **For details on a cancellation**, refer to the **status of the last invoice** to determine whether the subscription was ended due to failed payments, manual cancellation, or another reason.

1. **Subscription Payment Recycling and Retries**## Automatic Retry Process
* **Retries occur immediately on different processors** if available.

* **Revolv3 will retry payment attempts** based on a **predefined schedule**.

* If **multiple payment methods** are enabled, Revolv3 will **attempt additional cards** upon a failed transaction.## Soft Decline vs. Hard Decline
| **Decline Type** | **Behavior**                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Soft Decline** | The system **retries the payment** using the same or other available payment methods. |
| **Hard Decline** | The payment is **not retried**, and the subscription remains **unpaid or cancelled**. |## Default Retry Behavior
* Revolv3 will **attempt up to 15 retries** to process a **failed invoice**.

* The retry process **only applies to card-based payments** (ACH payments and one-time invoices are **not retried**).

* The **Recycle Strategy** follows rules configured in the **Recurring Strategies settings**.
