# Canceling a subscription## Canceling a Subscription in Revolv3 API
Merchants can **cancel active subscriptions** in Revolv3 using a simple API request. This stops further billing cycles, but it does **not automatically process refunds**â€”a separate request is required for refunds.

1. **API Endpoint for Subscription Cancellation**

To cancel a subscription, send a POST request to the following endpoint:

```
POST {{Api Root}}/api/Subscriptions/{{Active Subscription Id}}/cancel
```

* **Production Environment**: [https://api.revolv3.com](https://api.revolv3.com)

* **Sandbox Environment**: [https://api-sandbox.revolv3.com](https://api-sandbox.revolv3.com)

ðŸ“Œ **No request payload is required** for this operation.

1. **Response When Cancelling a Subscription**

Upon successful cancellation, the API returns a confirmation response, including the **subscription ID, customer ID, and cancellation timestamp**.## Sample API Response
```
{
  "subscriptionId": 2232,
  "customerId": 6684,
  "subscriptionStatus": "Cancelled",
  "cancelledAt": "2024-07-11T18:16:33.8785322Z"
}
```

1. **Explanation of API Response Fields**

| **Field**          | **Description**                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| subscriptionId     | The unique identifier of the subscription that was canceled.       |
| customerId         | The ID of the customer associated with the canceled subscription.  |
| subscriptionStatus | Confirms that the subscription is now in **Cancelled** status.     |
| cancelledAt        | The **timestamp** when the subscription was successfully canceled. |

1. **Important Notes on Subscription Cancellation**

âœ” **Canceling a subscription only stops future billing cycles**â€”it does not affect past invoices or payments.

âœ” If you need to issue a **refund**, you must make a separate API call to process a refund for a specific invoice.
