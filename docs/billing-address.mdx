1. **Accepted Billing Address Formats**

To pass validation, a **billing address** must include at least one of the following combinations:

âœ” **AddressLine1, City, and State**

âœ” **AddressLine1 and Postal Code**

âœ” **State and Postal Code**

âœ” **AddressID**

ðŸ“Œ **One of these formats is required; otherwise, the API will return an error.**

1. **Sample API Request with a Billing Address**

The following JSON request demonstrates a **valid billing address** structure:

```
{
  "PaymentMethod": {
    "BillingAddress": {
      "AddressLine1": "381 Forest Ave",
      "City": "Laguna Beach",
      "State": "CA",
      "PostalCode": "92651",
      "Country": "USA"
    },
    "BillingFirstName": "John",
    "BillingLastName": "Doe",
    "CreditCard": {
      "PaymentAccountNumber": "4111111111111111",
      "ExpirationDate": "0330",
      "SecurityCode": "737"
    }
  }
}
```

1. **Handling Validation Errors**

If the provided address does not meet the **minimum required fields**, the API will return an **error message** like the following:

```
{
  "errorMessage": "Neither an Address ID nor a required set of address fields were provided."
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Ensure that one of the accepted address formats is included in the request to prevent errors.**

1. **Additional Notes on Address Formatting**

âœ” **Country codes** should follow **ISO Alpha-2 or Alpha-3 abbreviations**.

âœ” **For U.S. addresses**, the postal code must be **exactly 5 characters**.

âœ” **For international addresses**, postal codes can be **up to 10 characters**.

âœ” **For many countries,** the **State** field is **not required**.

1. **Sample Billing Address for the United Kingdom**

For countries where the **State** field is not required, a **valid billing address** can be structured as follows (UK in this example):

```
{
  "BillingAddress": {
    "AddressLine1": "49 Featherstone Street",
    "City": "London",
    "PostalCode": "EC1Y 8SY",
    "Country": "GB"
  }
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Ensure that the postal code format follows the country-specific rules** to avoid validation errors.
