title: "API Versioning Policy"
description: "Understand the Revolv3 API versioning policy, including how we handle updates, deprecations, and breaking changes to ensure integration stability."
---

Our API follows a versioning strategy designed to ensure backward compatibility for standard releases while providing clear version updates for breaking changes. This approach minimizes disruptions for developers integrating with our API and ensures a smooth experience when new features or improvements are introduced.

**Backward Compatibility**

For most updates, API endpoints will remain backward compatible. This means that:

* Existing endpoints will continue to function without requiring changes in client implementations.
* Additions such as new optional parameters or response fields will not impact current integrations.
* Deprecations, if necessary, will be communicated well in advance, but existing functionality will not be removed abruptly.

**Breaking Changes & Version Updates**

In cases where changes might break existing integrations, we will introduce a new API version. Breaking changes include:

* Modifications to request or response structures that require client-side adjustments.
* Removal of existing parameters or endpoints.
* Significant changes in authentication or authorization mechanisms.

When a breaking change is required, the new version will be introduced under a distinct version identifier (e.g., `/v1`, `/v2`). Previous versions will remain available for a period of time to allow for migration.

**Version Deprecation Policy**

* Older API versions will remain operational for a defined period before deprecation.
* Deprecation schedules will be announced in advance to provide ample time for migration.
* Critical bug fixes may still be applied to older versions during the transition period.

**Recommendations for API Consumers**

To ensure seamless integration and future-proofing:

* Always handle additional or unknown fields in API responses gracefully.
* Follow API deprecation notices and migrate to newer versions as recommended.
