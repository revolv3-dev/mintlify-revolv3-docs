The **Revolv3 Checkout** feature enables merchants to **collect payments through an embedded form or a hosted checkout page**. This integration allows businesses to **seamlessly handle payments** while offering customers a smooth and optimized checkout experience across devices.## Feature Overview
Revolv3’s **Checkout integration** provides:

✔ **Clear order details** for customers before making a payment.

✔ **Multiple payment method support**, allowing flexibility.

✔ **Optimized UI/UX** for all devices, ensuring a seamless payment experience.

✔ **Two integration options**:

1. **Hosted Checkout Page** – Customers are redirected to a Revolv3-hosted payment page.

2. **Embedded Checkout** – Checkout is directly embedded within a merchant’s website.## Basic Configuration Requirements
Before integrating the **Checkout feature**, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1️⃣ **You have an active Revolv3 account**.

2️⃣ **You have a merchant account with one or more configured payment processors**.

3️⃣ **You have already generated a Developer API Key** for authentication.## Configuring Trusted Hostnames for Checkout
To use Revolv3’s **Checkout feature**, merchants must register **trusted hostnames** in their Revolv3 portal. This ensures secure access to the **Checkout endpoints** and the hosted payment page.## Steps to Configure Trusted Hostnames
1️⃣ Navigate to **Merchant Settings → Integration Profile** in the Revolv3 portal.

2️⃣ Scroll down to the section **Trusted Checkout Hostnames**.

3️⃣ Add the hostname(s) from which checkout requests will be made.

4️⃣ Ensure that the added hostname matches your website domain.## Example
If your website URL is:

```
https://mysite.com
```

Then, register the hostname as:

| **SITENAME**     | **HOSTNAME** |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Our main website | mysite.com   |

* **SITENAME** can be any descriptive name for reference.

* **HOSTNAME** must match the domain from which Checkout requests originate.
