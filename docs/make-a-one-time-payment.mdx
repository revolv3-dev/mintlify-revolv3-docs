**Make 1 API call** Use API: \{\{Api Root}}/api/Invoices/Payment

For the \{\{Api Root}} variable:

**Production:**

```
https://api.revolv3.com
```

**Sandbox:**

```
https://api-sandbox.revolv3.com
```

This is a POST request with a sample payload below. This call is also in the API docs. Additional calls around payments can also be found in the docs.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
  	"FirstName": "John",
  	"LastName": "Smith",
  	"MerchantCustomerRefId": "",
  	"EntityUseCode": null,
  	"PaymentMethod": {
  		"BillingAddress": {
                      "AddressLine1": "381 Forest Ave. Suite C",
                      "City": "Laguna Beach",
                      "State": "CA",
                      "PostalCode": "92651",
                      "Country": "USA"
                  },
  		"BillingFirstName": "John",
  		"BillingLastName": "Smith",
          "creditCard": {
              "paymentAccountNumber": "123456789123456",
              "expirationDate": "0127",
              "securityCode": "123"
          }
  	},
  	"Invoice": {
  		"MerchantInvoiceRefId": "",
  		"EntityUseCode": null,
  		"InvoiceLineItems": [
  			{
  				"InvoiceLineItemId": 0,
  				"Name": "One Time Charge",
  				"Description": "Value for 600.00 dollars",
  				"Value": 600.00,
  				"ValueType": "Standard",
  				"TaxCode": null
  			}
  		]
  	}
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The response from this would be

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
      "customerId": 64,
      "invoiceId": 991,
      "merchantInvoiceRefId": "",
      "invoiceStatus": "Paid",
      "invoiceAttemptStatus": "Success",
      "message": "Authorised",
      "subtotal": 600.00,
      "taxAmount": 0.0,
      "total": 600.00,
      "paymentMethodId": 585
  }
