**Core Functionality Updates**

| Changes | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Trial Marking for Initial Recurring Transactions | We’ve added the ability for merchants to mark the **first recurring payment** as a **trial transaction**.  <br/>**Key details**:  <br/>* A new portal setting lets merchants enable trial marking for supported processors.  <br/>* When enabled, the system automatically appends **“Trial”** to the transaction descriptor for the initial recurring payment.  <br/>* Works with both static and dynamic descriptors, while ensuring compliance with processor-specific descriptor length rules.  <br/>* Phase 1: available for **Worldpay** integration.  <br/>This enhancement provides greater flexibility in handling recurring billing scenarios where the initial transaction should be clearly identified as a trial. |



**API Reference Guide Updates**

| Changes | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Processor and MID Information in Payment Responses | We have enhanced payment API responses to include additional processor-related parameters:<br/><br/>* **paymentProcessor** – the name of the processor handling the transaction (e.g., WorldPay).<br/><br/>* **processorMerchantId** – the merchant account ID (MID) assigned by the processor (e.g., 10071676).<br/><br/>These parameters are now available in responses for the following endpoints:<br/><br/>* Sale (with/without Payment Method details)<br/>* Auth (with/without Payment Method details)<br/>* Capture<br/>* Create Subscription<br/><br/>Merchants can now easily identify which processor and merchant processor account were used for each transaction, improving transparency and simplifying reconciliation across multiple processors. |

| :----------------------------------- | :---------- |
| **New Integration: BridgePay Now Available on the Portal** | We are pleased to announce the integration of **BridgePay** into our platform, providing merchants with a robust and versatile payment processing solution.<br/>**Key Features:**<br/><br/>* **Comprehensive Transaction Support:** Process a wide range of transactions, including authorizations, sales, refunds, and more.<br/>* **Tokenization Capabilities:** Utilize both one-time and recurring tokenized transactions to enhance security and streamline payment processes.<br/>* **Descriptor Flexibility:** Configure either static or dynamic descriptor to ensure clear transaction labeling on customer statements.<br/>* **Dynamic Routing Participation:** Leverage BridgePay in dynamic routing setups to optimize approval rates and enhance transaction success. |
| **Subscription Support for Nuvei**   | We have added support for **recurring and recycling billing** through Nuvei. Merchants can now create and manage subscription-based transactions using Nuvei as their payment processor. |



**API Reference Guide Updates**

| Changes | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| **New API Endpoint: Configure BridgePay for Merchants** | We have introduced a [new API endpoint](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/post_api-onboarding-processors-bridgepay) that enables merchants to configure **BridgePay** as a payment processor directly through the API. This addition streamlines the setup process, allowing for efficient integration and management of BridgePay within merchant accounts. |
| **Currency Support in Subscription Transactions** | We have extended subscription transactions to include a **currency parameter**. The system now:<br/><br/>* [Sends the specified currency to the processor](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/post_api-subscriptions) if supported.<br/>* Returns a clear error message if the currency is not supported by the configured processor.<br/>* Stores the currency in subscription records, invoices, and processor transactions. |
| **Flexible Billing Frequency for Subscriptions** | We’ve enhanced subscription settings by replacing the fixed `billingFrequencyType` values with a flexible interval-based configuration. Merchants can now [define billing cycles](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/post_api-subscriptions) using a combination of:<br/><br/>* **intervalCount** (numeric value)<br/>* **intervalType** (days, weeks, months, or years)<br/><br/>This allows for fully customizable recurring billing schedules — for example, every 28 days — and updates both the trial duration options and recurring logic accordingly. Existing subscriptions have been migrated to support the new format. |
| **Enhanced Bulk Invoice Retrieval** | We have introduced an improved **[Get Invoices](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/get_api-invoices)** endpoint that allows merchants to retrieve multiple invoices in a single request (up to 100), with expanded filtering, sorting, and data details.<br/>**Key enhancements include:**<br/><br/>* Support for bulk invoice retrieval with advanced filters (by billing date, last update date, etc.)<br/>* Additional sorting options and improved parameter handling<br/>* Detailed payment information in the response, including payment type, token details, descriptor, and currency<br/>* Ability to request raw processor response data for deeper insights<br/><br/>The existing **[Get Invoices](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/get_api-invoices)** endpoint remains available, but the new version offers significantly more flexibility and richer data. |

**Core Functionality Updates**

| Changes | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Direct PAN Usage for Initial Transactions with Worldpay | Previously, during payment processing via Worldpay, we first requested a token and then executed the payment using the token. With this update, the Primary Account Number (PAN) is now directly utilized for the first transaction, streamlining the process and reducing latency for initial payments. |
| Configurable Retry Timing for Backup Processor Payments | We have introduced a feature that allows configuring the delay before the system retries a payment with the backup processor if the initial attempt with the primary processor fails. By default, the retry is immediate (0 minutes), but you can now set a delay of up to 60 minutes. This provides greater flexibility in managing transaction retries and optimizing payment workflows. |

This new implementation improves reliability, transparency, and efficiency when notifying external systems about events. <br/>**Key Features:**<br/>* Stateful Webhooks: Each webhook now includes the state of the entity at the moment of generation, ensuring accurate context for external systems.<br/>* Retry Mechanism: Supports progressive retries in case of transient failures, enhancing delivery reliability.<br/>* Preserved Order: Webhooks are processed sequentially for each merchant, preventing disorder and ensuring consistent event streams. Processing halts and resumes as issues are resolved.<br/>* Custom Configuration: Merchants can now define specific webhook types they wish to receive, reducing system load and unnecessary notifications.<br/>This update ensures a robust, scalable, and configurable webhook experience for merchants and their integrated systems. |
| Optimized EPX Transaction Processing | Transactions with EPX now process faster by using the PAN for the first payment when no token is available. Token retrieval happens in parallel, ensuring seamless processing for subsequent transactions. |
