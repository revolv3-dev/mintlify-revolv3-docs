## Welcome to the Revolv3 Developer Hub

This is the central resource for integrating with the Revolv3 API. Here you'll find everything you need to build powerful, resilient subscription and billing logic for your application. Our goal is to provide clear, comprehensive documentation that helps you get up and running as quickly as possible.

Our documentation is organized into three main sections for your convenience:

<CardGroup cols={3}>

    href="/docs/getting-started"
  >
    Explore step-by-step tutorials and practical examples for key features and common use-cases, from creating your first subscription to managing complex billing scenarios.

  <Card
    title="API Reference"

    href="https://docs.revolv3.com/api-reference/payments/sale-with-payment-method-details"
