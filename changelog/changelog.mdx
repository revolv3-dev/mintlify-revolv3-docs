# Core Functionality Updates

| Changes | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Trial Marking for Initial Recurring Transactions | We’ve added the ability for merchants to mark the **first recurring payment** as a **trial transaction**.  <br/>**Key details**:  <br/>* A new portal setting lets merchants enable trial marking for supported processors.  <br/>* When enabled, the system automatically appends **“Trial”** to the transaction descriptor for the initial recurring payment.  <br/>* Works with both static and dynamic descriptors, while ensuring compliance with processor-specific descriptor length rules.  <br/>* Phase 1: available for **Worldpay** integration.  <br/>This enhancement provides greater flexibility in handling recurring billing scenarios where the initial transaction should be clearly identified as a trial. |


# API Reference Guide Updates

| Changes | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Processor and MID Information in Payment Responses | We have enhanced payment API responses to include additional processor-related parameters:<br/><br/>* **paymentProcessor** – the name of the processor handling the transaction (e.g., WorldPay).<br/><br/>* **processorMerchantId** – the merchant account ID (MID) assigned by the processor (e.g., 10071676).<br/><br/>These parameters are now available in responses for the following endpoints:<br/><br/>* Sale (with/without Payment Method details)<br/>* Auth (with/without Payment Method details)<br/>* Capture<br/>* Create Subscription<br/><br/>Merchants can now easily identify which processor and merchant processor account were used for each transaction, improving transparency and simplifying reconciliation across multiple processors. |

# Core Functionality Updates

| Changes                              | Description |
| :----------------------------------- | :---------- |
| **New Integration: BridgePay Now Available on the Portal** | We are pleased to announce the integration of **BridgePay** into our platform, providing merchants with a robust and versatile payment processing solution.<br/>**Key Features:**<br/><br/>* **Comprehensive Transaction Support:** Process a wide range of transactions, including authorizations, sales, refunds, and more.<br/>* **Tokenization Capabilities:** Utilize both one-time and recurring tokenized transactions to enhance security and streamline payment processes.<br/>* **Descriptor Flexibility:** Configure either static or dynamic descriptor to ensure clear transaction labeling on customer statements.<br/>* **Dynamic Routing Participation:** Leverage BridgePay in dynamic routing setups to optimize approval rates and enhance transaction success. |
| **Subscription Support for Nuvei**   | We have added support for **recurring and recycling billing** through Nuvei. Merchants can now create and manage subscription-based transactions using Nuvei as their payment processor. |



# API Reference Guide Updates

| Changes | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| **New API Endpoint: Configure BridgePay for Merchants** | We have introduced a [new API endpoint](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/post_api-onboarding-processors-bridgepay) that enables merchants to configure **BridgePay** as a payment processor directly through the API. This addition streamlines the setup process, allowing for efficient integration and management of BridgePay within merchant accounts. |
| **Currency Support in Subscription Transactions** | We have extended subscription transactions to include a **currency parameter**. The system now:<br/><br/>* [Sends the specified currency to the processor](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/post_api-subscriptions) if supported.<br/>* Returns a clear error message if the currency is not supported by the configured processor.<br/>* Stores the currency in subscription records, invoices, and processor transactions. |
| **Flexible Billing Frequency for Subscriptions** | We’ve enhanced subscription settings by replacing the fixed `billingFrequencyType` values with a flexible interval-based configuration. Merchants can now [define billing cycles](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/post_api-subscriptions) using a combination of:<br/><br/>* **intervalCount** (numeric value)<br/>* **intervalType** (days, weeks, months, or years)<br/><br/>This allows for fully customizable recurring billing schedules — for example, every 28 days — and updates both the trial duration options and recurring logic accordingly. Existing subscriptions have been migrated to support the new format. |
| **Enhanced Bulk Invoice Retrieval** | We have introduced an improved **[Get Invoices](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/get_api-invoices)** endpoint that allows merchants to retrieve multiple invoices in a single request (up to 100), with expanded filtering, sorting, and data details.<br/>**Key enhancements include:**<br/><br/>* Support for bulk invoice retrieval with advanced filters (by billing date, last update date, etc.)<br/>* Additional sorting options and improved parameter handling<br/>* Detailed payment information in the response, including payment type, token details, descriptor, and currency<br/>* Ability to request raw processor response data for deeper insights<br/><br/>The existing **[Get Invoices](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/get_api-invoices)** endpoint remains available, but the new version offers significantly more flexibility and richer data. |
