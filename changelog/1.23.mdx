        New API Endpoint: Configure BridgePay for Merchants
      </td>

      <td>
        We have introduced a 

        [new API endpoint](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/post_api-onboarding-processors-bridgepay)

         that enables merchants to configure **BridgePay **as a payment processor directly through the API. This addition streamlines the setup process, allowing for efficient integration and management of BridgePay within merchant accounts.

      <td>
        Currency Support in Subscription Transactions
      </td>

      <td>
        We have extended subscription transactions to include a **currency parameter**. The system now:

        * [Sends the specified currency to the processor](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/post_api-subscriptions) if supported.
        * Returns a clear error message if the currency is not supported by the configured processor.
        * Stores the currency in subscription records, invoices, and processor transactions.

    <tr>
      <td>
        Flexible Billing Frequency for Subscriptions
      </td>

      <td>
        We’ve enhanced subscription settings by replacing the fixed `billingFrequencyType` values with a flexible interval-based configuration. Merchants can now [define billing cycles](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/post_api-subscriptions) using a combination of:

        * **intervalCount** (numeric value)
        * **intervalType** (days, weeks, months, or years)

        This allows for fully customizable recurring billing schedules — for example, every 28 days — and updates both the trial duration options and recurring logic accordingly. Existing subscriptions have been migrated to support the new format.

    <tr>
      <td>
        Enhanced Bulk Invoice Retrieval
      </td>

      <td>
        We have introduced an improved **[Get Invoices](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/get_api-invoices)** endpoint that allows merchants to retrieve multiple invoices in a single request (up to 100), with expanded filtering, sorting, and data details.
        **Key enhancements include:**

        * Support for bulk invoice retrieval with advanced filters (by billing date, last update date, etc.)
        * Additional sorting options and improved parameter handling
        * Detailed payment information in the response, including payment type, token details, descriptor, and currency
        * Ability to request raw processor response data for deeper insights

        The existing **[Get Invoices](https://docs.revolv3.com/reference/get_api-invoices)** endpoint remains available, but the new version offers significantly more flexibility and richer data.
