# Core Functionality Updates

| Changes | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Trial Marking for Initial Recurring Transactions | We’ve added the ability for merchants to mark the **first recurring payment** as a **trial transaction**.  <br/>**Key details**:  <br/>* A new portal setting lets merchants enable trial marking for supported processors.  <br/>* When enabled, the system automatically appends **“Trial”** to the transaction descriptor for the initial recurring payment.  <br/>* Works with both static and dynamic descriptors, while ensuring compliance with processor-specific descriptor length rules.  <br/>* Phase 1: available for **Worldpay** integration.  <br/>This enhancement provides greater flexibility in handling recurring billing scenarios where the initial transaction should be clearly identified as a trial. |


# API Reference Guide Updates

| Changes | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Processor and MID Information in Payment Responses | We have enhanced payment API responses to include additional processor-related parameters:<br/><br/>* **paymentProcessor** – the name of the processor handling the transaction (e.g., WorldPay).<br/><br/>* **processorMerchantId** – the merchant account ID (MID) assigned by the processor (e.g., 10071676).<br/><br/>These parameters are now available in responses for the following endpoints:<br/><br/>* Sale (with/without Payment Method details)<br/>* Auth (with/without Payment Method details)<br/>* Capture<br/>* Create Subscription<br/><br/>Merchants can now easily identify which processor and merchant processor account were used for each transaction, improving transparency and simplifying reconciliation across multiple processors. |
