# Core Functionality Updates

| Changes | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Trial Marking for Initial Recurring Transactions | We’ve added the ability for merchants to mark the **first recurring payment** as a **trial transaction**.  <br>**Key details**:  <br>* A new portal setting lets merchants enable trial marking for supported processors.  <br>* When enabled, the system automatically appends **“Trial”** to the transaction descriptor for the initial recurring payment.  <br>* Works with both static and dynamic descriptors, while ensuring compliance with processor-specific descriptor length rules.  <br>* Phase 1: available for **Worldpay** integration.  <br>This enhancement provides greater flexibility in handling recurring billing scenarios where the initial transaction should be clearly identified as a trial. |

        Processor and MID Information in Payment Responses
      </td>

      <td>
        We have enhanced payment API responses to include additional processor-related parameters:

        * **paymentProcessor** – the name of the processor handling the transaction (e.g., WorldPay).

        * **processorMerchantId** – the merchant account ID (MID) assigned by the processor (e.g., 10071676).

        These parameters are now available in responses for the following endpoints:

        * Sale (with/without Payment Method details)

        * Auth (with/without Payment Method details)

        * Capture

        * Create Subscription

        Merchants can now easily identify which processor and merchant processor account were used for each transaction, improving transparency and simplifying reconciliation across multiple processors.
